# Workshop-4

https://amiarr.github.io/Workshop-4/

For this task I made a sketch with user input events, the task required 3, however I only had 2 successful user input events, as I couldn't manage to add images into my sketch for some reason, as evident by the code of my sketch. The 2 user input events that I did include was the text box and the slider, I was interested in how the slider was used to change the shade of the background, so I used ChatGPT to learn how to change the background from red to pink.
