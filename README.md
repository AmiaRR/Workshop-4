# Workshop-4

https://amiarr.github.io/Workshop-4/

For this task I made a sketch with user input events, the task required 3, however I only had 2 successful user input events, as I couldn't manage to add images into my sketch for some reason. As evident by my sketch, there was an attempt to add images, but unfortunantly this didn't work after trying to follow the tutorial closely, I'm not sure exactly what I did wrong. The 2 user input events that I did include was the text box and the slider, I was interested in how the slider was used to change the shade of the background, so I used ChatGPT to learn how to change the background from red to pink.
